Welcome to the **Free Science Academy**!

It is our understanding that, whatever the 'open science community' is, it is disorganised and fragmented, both internally and externaly and particularly with its messaging. Unlike the Free and Open Source Software movements, we feel it does not have the same philosophical underpinnings to help unite the community. We see our unique role in this space to formalise, legitimise, and coalesce the existing community and communities. The FSA is a fully democratic and decentralised organisation representing this.

The aims of the FSA are to help to legitimise the community, and give more recognition to open research practices. The primary expected outcome is the more structured growth of the community by providing a more comfortable and legal structure to be part of. We believe this is required to transform 'open science', 'open scholarship, and 'open research' into a real, formalised community and social movement.

We believe that it only takes a small number of caring, thoughtful, and committed citizens to become influential in society and catalyse real change for good.

## Mission statement

The FSA is an informal resurgence of the Society for Free Science, established in 1940 but now long since gone. We follow a revised version of their 5 core propositions, or fundamental freedoms:

1. Increase of knowledge by scientific research and its diffusion have a primary human value;
2. Science can only flourish in an atmosphere of freedom;
3. Scientific life should be autonomous;
4. Conditions of research appointments should give workers freedom to choose their own problems;
5. scientific people in countries not under dictatorial rule should co-operate to maintain freedom of research.

In order to achieve this, we will operate at three core levels:

1. Sustained, political and public advocacy.
2. Development of shared tools, services, and infrastructure supporting science.
3. Community development.

## Principles, virtues, and values that we follow and uphold:

**Integrity** - We pledge to uphold the highest degrees of ethical and moral conduct, both as researchers and humans.

**Freedom** - We act, and expect others to act, without constraints, except for those imposed by our own moral standards and beliefs.

**Accountability** - We accept full responsibility for our actions and behaviours.

**Honesty** - We never intentionally deceive or mislead others.

**Truth** - We always strive to ascertain the truth, no matter the situation.

**Justice** - To follow the function of the law and human rights, and encode them in our beliefs and practices.

**Tolerance** - We are accepting of all individuals, no matter what their views or backgrounds are.

**Patience** - To operate at a pace in which all members of the community can contribute in their capacities.

**Forgiveness** - Any transgression can be forgiven.

**Courage** - We stand up for what we believe in.
